# deCRYPTme
Side project where I attempt to encrypt/decrypt text using different kinds of ciphers

### 08/11/2017
> added Caesar cipher functionality

### 08/16/2017
> added simple substitution cipher
> Next up: making a key generator based off a used inputted string (ex. the word zebra generates
"zebracdfghijklmnopqstuvwxy")
> looking into vignere ciphers
